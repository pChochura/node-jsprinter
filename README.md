# Setup

To start the program that opens a port 40023 hosting a local network printer, just type:

> npm start

Then you have to install the printer on your system by executing the `install_printer.ps1` program (you have to escalate privileges on your shell to do that)

> Powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install_printer.ps1
